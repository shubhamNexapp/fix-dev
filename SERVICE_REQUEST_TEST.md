# Service Request Test

To test if your service request is working, you can use this curl command:

```bash
# Test service request event via Socket.IO client
# You'll need to test this from your frontend, but here's what should happen:

# 1. User registers on socket: ✅ (working - we see this in logs)
# 2. User sends service request with this data:
{
  "userId": "68b067932ba36a3c4bad6f2d",
  "userLocation": {
    "latitude": 20.389938333333333,
    "longitude": 78.13068333333334
  },
  "serviceType": "general_help",
  "description": "I need help with my service request",
  "requestId": "req_1234567890"
}

# 3. Backend should log: "🚨 Service request received:" followed by the data
# 4. Backend should validate and process the request
# 5. Backend should broadcast to providers
```

## What was the issue?

The problem was in the **backend validation**. Your frontend sends this data:
```javascript
const serviceRequest = {
  userId: userId,
  userLocation: { latitude: ..., longitude: ... },
  serviceType: 'general_help',
  description: 'I need help with my service request',
  requestId: `req_${Date.now()}`,
  // ❌ Missing 'urgency' field
};
```

But your backend was requiring the `urgency` field:
```javascript
const missing = validateSocketData(data, ['requestId', 'userId', 'serviceType', 'description', 'userLocation', 'urgency']);
```

## Fix Applied:

1. ✅ **Removed urgency from required fields** - now it's optional with default 'medium'
2. ✅ **Added debug logging** - now you'll see "🚨 Service request received:" 
3. ✅ **Added better error logging** - shows exactly which fields are missing
4. ✅ **Added confirmation response** - sends back confirmation to user

## Expected Logs After Fix:

```
🚨 Service request received: { userId: '68b067932ba36a3c4bad6f2d', userLocation: {...}, ... }
🚨 New service request req_1694876543210 from user 68b067932ba36a3c4bad6f2d
📢 Service request req_1694876543210 broadcasted to 1 providers
```

Try sending a service request from your frontend now - you should see these logs!
